    + Fix failure to check per-column SELECT privileges in some join queries
      (Tom Lane)

      In some cases involving joins, the parser failed to record all the
      columns read by a query in the column-usage bitmaps that are used for
      permissions checking.  Although the executor would still insist on some
      sort of SELECT privilege to run the query, this meant that a user having
      SELECT privilege on only one column of a table could nonetheless read
      all its columns through a suitably crafted query.

      A stored view that is subject to this problem will have incomplete
      column-usage bitmaps, and thus permissions will still not be enforced
      properly on the view after updating.  In installations that depend on
      column-level permissions for security, it is recommended to CREATE OR
      REPLACE all user-defined views to cause them to be re-parsed.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Sven Klemm for reporting this problem.

    + Fix information leakage in constraint-violation error messages
      (Heikki Linnakangas)

      If an UPDATE command attempts to move a row to a different partition but
      finds that it violates some constraint on the new partition, and the
      columns in that partition are in different physical positions than in
      the parent table, the error message could reveal the contents of columns
      that the user does not have SELECT privilege on. (CVE-2021-3393)

    + Fix incorrect detection of concurrent page splits while inserting into a
      GiST index (Heikki Linnakangas)

      Concurrent insertions could lead to a corrupt index with entries placed
      in the wrong pages.  It's recommended to reindex any GiST index that's
      been subject to concurrent insertions.

    + Fix CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to wait for concurrent prepared
      transactions (Andrey Borodin)

      At the point where CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY waits for all concurrent
      transactions to complete so that it can see rows they inserted, it must
      also wait for all prepared transactions to complete, for the same
      reason.  Its failure to do so meant that rows inserted by prepared
      transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing queries
      relying on the index to miss such rows. In installations that have
      enabled prepared transactions (max_prepared_transactions > 0), it's
      recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this
      problem occurred when they were built.

    + Block DECLARE CURSOR ... WITH HOLD and firing of deferred triggers
      within index expressions and materialized view queries (Noah Misch)

      This is essentially a leak in the security restricted operation sandbox
      mechanism.  An attacker having permission to create non-temporary SQL
      objects could parlay this leak to execute arbitrary SQL code as a
      superuser.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Etienne Stalmans for reporting this
      problem. (CVE-2020-25695)

    + Fix usage of complex connection-string parameters in pg_dump,
      pg_restore, clusterdb, reindexdb, and vacuumdb (Tom Lane)

      The -d parameter of pg_dump and pg_restore, or the --maintenance-db
      parameter of the other programs mentioned, can be a connection string
      containing multiple connection parameters rather than just a database
      name.  In cases where these programs need to initiate additional
      connections, such as parallel processing or processing of multiple
      databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the basic
      connection parameters (database name, host, port, and username) were
      used for the additional connections.  This could lead to connection
      failures if the connection string included any other essential
      information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters. Worse, the
      connection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
      vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
      parameters would have prevented. (CVE-2020-25694)

    + When psql's \connect command re-uses connection parameters, ensure that
      all non-overridden parameters from a previous connection string are
      re-used (Tom Lane)

      This avoids cases where reconnection might fail due to omission of
      relevant parameters, such as non-default SSL or GSS options. Worse, the
      reconnection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
      vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
      parameters would have prevented. This is largely the same problem as
      just cited for pg_dump et al, although psql's behavior is more complex
      since the user may intentionally override some connection parameters.
      (CVE-2020-25694)

    + Prevent psql's \gset command from modifying specially-treated variables
      (Noah Misch)

      \gset without a prefix would overwrite whatever variables the server
      told it to.  Thus, a compromised server could set specially-treated
      variables such as PROMPT1, giving the ability to execute arbitrary shell
      code in the user's session.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Nick Cleaton for reporting this problem.
