      Fix failure to check per-column <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privileges
      in some join queries (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      In some cases involving joins, the parser failed to record all the
      columns read by a query in the column-usage bitmaps that are used
      for permissions checking.  Although the executor would still insist
      on some sort of <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege to run the
      query, this meant that a user having <code class="literal">SELECT</code>
      privilege on only one column of a table could nonetheless read all
      its columns through a suitably crafted query.
     </p><p>
      A stored view that is subject to this problem will have incomplete
      column-usage bitmaps, and thus permissions will still not be
      enforced properly on the view after updating.  In installations that
      depend on column-level permissions for security, it is recommended
      to <code class="command">CREATE OR REPLACE</code> all user-defined views to
      cause them to be re-parsed.
     </p><p>
      The <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> Project thanks
      Sven Klemm for reporting this problem.

      Fix information leakage in constraint-violation error messages
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>
      If an <code class="command">UPDATE</code> command attempts to move a row to a
      different partition but finds that it violates some constraint on
      the new partition, and the columns in that partition are in
      different physical positions than in the parent table, the error
      message could reveal the contents of columns that the user does not
      have <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege on.

      Fix incorrect detection of concurrent page splits while inserting
      into a GiST index (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p><p>
      Concurrent insertions could lead to a corrupt index with entries
      placed in the wrong pages.  It's recommended to reindex any GiST
      index that's been subject to concurrent insertions.

      Fix <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to wait for
      concurrent prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin)
     </p><p>
      At the point where <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>
      waits for all concurrent transactions to complete so that it can see
      rows they inserted, it must also wait for all prepared transactions
      to complete, for the same reason.  Its failure to do so meant that
      rows inserted by prepared transactions might be omitted from the new
      index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows.
      In installations that have enabled prepared transactions
      (<code class="varname">max_prepared_transactions</code> &gt; 0),
      it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in
      case this problem occurred when they were built.

      Fix edge case in incremental sort (Neil Chen)
     </p><p>
      If the last tuple of a sort batch chanced to be the first tuple of
      the next group of already-sorted tuples, the code did the wrong
      thing.  This could lead to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">retrieved too many tuples in a

      results.

     </p><p>
      In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 13, this case reliably
      caused a null-pointer dereference.  In earlier versions the bug
      seems to have no visible symptoms, but it's not quite clear that
      it could never cause a problem.

      Avoid unnecessary errors with <code class="literal">BEFORE UPDATE</code>

     </p><p>
      A <code class="literal">BEFORE UPDATE FOR EACH ROW</code> trigger that
      modified the row in any way prevented <code class="command">UPDATE</code> from
      moving the row to another partition when needed; but there is no
      longer any reason for this restriction.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix partition pruning logic to handle asymmetric hash partition sets
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If a hash-partitioned table has unequally-sized partitions (that is,
      varying modulus values), or it lacks partitions for some remainder
      values, then the planner's pruning logic could mistakenly conclude
      that some partitions don't need to be scanned, leading to failure to
      find rows that the query should find.

      Avoid incorrect results when <code class="literal">WHERE CURRENT OF</code> is
      applied to a cursor whose plan contains a MergeAppend node (Tom

     </p><p>
      This case is unsupported (in general, a cursor using <code class="literal">ORDER

      previously did not reject it, and could silently give false matches.

     </p><p>
      This occurs in particular with trivial subqueries containing lateral
      references to outer-join outputs.  The mistake could result in a
      malformed plan.  The known cases trigger a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">failed to assign

      This is only a hazard when <code class="varname">wal_level</code> is set

      Prevent misprocessing of ambiguous <code class="command">CREATE TABLE

     </p><p>
      A <code class="literal">LIKE</code> clause is re-examined after initial
      creation of the new table, to handle importation of indexes and
      such.  It was possible for this re-examination to find a different
      table of the same name, causing unexpected behavior; one example is
      where the new table is a temporary table of the same name as
      the <code class="literal">LIKE</code> target.

      Rearrange order of operations in <code class="command">CREATE TABLE

      This fixes the case where a self-referential foreign key constraint

      Ensure that disk space allocated for a dropped relation is released
      promptly at commit (Thomas Munro)
     </p><p>
      Previously, if the dropped relation spanned multiple 1GB segments,
      only the first segment was truncated immediately.  Other segments
      were simply unlinked, which doesn't authorize the kernel to release
      the storage so long as any other backends still have the files open.

      A backslash followed by a multibyte character was not handled

     </p><p>
      We can concatenate two JSON objects or two JSON arrays.  Handle

      The wraparound point typically falls in the middle of a page, which
      must be rounded off to a page boundary, and that was not done
      correctly.  No issue could arise unless an installation had gotten
      to within one page of SLRU overflow, which is unlikely in a

      A <code class="command">CALL</code> in a PL/pgSQL procedure, to another
      procedure that has OUT parameters, would fail if the called
      procedure did a <code class="command">COMMIT</code>
      or <code class="command">ROLLBACK</code>.

      In <span class="application">libpq</span>, do not skip trying SSL after
      GSS encryption (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      If we successfully made a GSS-encrypted connection, but then failed
      during authentication, we would fall back to an unencrypted
      connection rather than next trying an SSL-encrypted connection.
      This could lead to unexpected connection failure, or to silently
      getting an unencrypted connection where an encrypted one is
      expected.  Fortunately, GSS encryption could only succeed if both
      client and server hold valid tickets in the same Kerberos
      infrastructure.  It seems unlikely for that to be true in an
      environment that requires SSL encryption instead.

      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span>'s dumping of inherited

      Previously, these commands would be run by the role that started the

      If an extension's script creates an object and grants privileges

      Make <code class="filename">contrib/pg_prewarm</code> more robust when the

     </p><p>
      Previously, autoprewarm would rewrite its status file with only the
      block numbers that it had managed to load so far, thus perhaps
      largely disabling the prewarm functionality in the next startup.
      Instead, suppress status file updates until the initial loading pass
      is complete.

      Fix miscalculation of timeouts
      in <code class="filename">contrib/pg_prewarm</code>
      and <code class="filename">contrib/postgres_fdw</code>
      (Alexey Kondratov, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      The main loop in <code class="filename">contrib/pg_prewarm</code>'s
      autoprewarm parent process underestimated its desired sleep time by
      a factor of 1000, causing it to consume much more CPU than intended.
      When waiting for a result from a remote
      server, <code class="filename">contrib/postgres_fdw</code> overestimated the
      desired timeout by a factor of 1000 (though this error had been
      mitigated by imposing a clamp to 60 seconds).
     </p><p>
      Both of these errors stemmed from incorrectly converting
      seconds-and-microseconds to milliseconds.  Introduce a new
      API <code class="function">TimestampDifferenceMilliseconds()</code>
      to make it easier to get this right in the future.

      The new method is more likely to produce desirable results when
      Xcode is newer than the underlying operating system.  Choosing
      a sysroot that does not match the OS version may result in
      nonfunctional executables.
